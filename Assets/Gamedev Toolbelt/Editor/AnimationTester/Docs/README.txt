Hi! I'm Christian, the author of AnimationTester. Thank you for your purchase!


     WHAT IS ANIMATIONTESTER?

AnimationTester is a small extension which lets you choose and preview animations at runtime, to eliminate the need for "controller juggling".

I was an animator during my game development master's, and I quickly learned that testing models and animations in-engine is a major pain, as you not only need to see them under different lighting conditions, you also have to create a new FSM or controller to direct to your particular clip, or "play" until the clip you want to check out is used.

AnimationTester solves that. Testing animations in-engine is a snap.


     HOW DO I USE IT?

Using AnimationTester is quite straightforward.
First, open the AnimationTester window (Window -> Gamedev Toolbelt -> AnimationTester); all gameobjects in the scene with an Animator or Animation will be selectable in the first popup.
After entering play mode, you will then be able to select the animation, click play, and see it played!


     WILL IT BREAK MY ANIMATORS?

Absolutely NOT! I developed AnimationTester to be the boy scout of assets, it won't leave any rubbish behind.
If you want to see it in action you can go to http://immortalhydra.com/stuff/animation-tester/.


     WHERE CAN I FIND MORE INFORMATION?

Pretty much all you need to know is either here or on the AnimationTester page, but you can write me if you want to! You can reach me @hherebus on Twitter, or by writing me a quick email at support@immortalhydra.com.
